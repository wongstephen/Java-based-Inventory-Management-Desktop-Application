## DESCRIPTION

This is a simple inventory management system that allows users to add, update, and delete items from an inventory. The inventory is stored in a database and the user can interact with the inventory through a command line interface.

## SCENARIO

You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

## REQUIREMENTS

The program should allow users to:
* Add a new item to the inventory
* Update an existing item's quantity in the inventory
* Delete an item from the inventory
* View the current inventory

## INSTRUCTIONS
* Clone the repository
* Run main from main.java
